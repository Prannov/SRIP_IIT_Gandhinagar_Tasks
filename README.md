# SRIP_IIT_Gandhinagar_Tasks
This repository is solely made for the tasks given by IIT Gandhinagar.

The repository consists of only one task, i.e., Task 3 : Implement two hidden layers neural network classifier from scratch in JAX. The complete procedure of the task is written in the experiment.

The other tasks were not done due to the time limitations.
However, the final task, i.e., Task 4 : Bayesian Linear Regression from scratch with BlackJAX, motivated me to learn about BlackJAX. I was not familiar with BlackJAX prior to this task. I tries using sampling techniques in BlackJAX but resulted in errors. 

These tasks motivated me to learn more. I thank Prof. Nipun Batra and Zeel Patel.
